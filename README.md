- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library + Vite

### What I learned

Stopped using reactJS for a while because I was doing some other projects for university. Remembering now some of the basics.
Getting better and quicker at developing for mobile.

### Continued development

Still to work on remembering the basics of reactJS, forgot some of them already.
Mobile development also needs improvements, trying to figure out best units to work and how to use them.
